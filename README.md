# Xtext Visual Studio Code Example

This is an [Example](https://github.com/itemis/xtext-languageserver-example/blob/master/vscode-extension-self-contained/README.md) showing the Visual Studio Code Integration of Xtext using the Microsoft Language Server Protocol.


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/itemis/xtext-languageserver-example.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/itemis/xtext-languageserver-example)

## Quickstart

Requires Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with version 1.4.0 or greater to be on the path as `code` and Java 8+ available as `java`.

- Run `./gradlew startCode`

This will start VS Code and after a few seconds load the `demo` folder of this repository.

## Project Structure

- `vscode-extension` (node based VS Code extension to run with a separate server using socket)
- `vscode-extension-self-contained` (node based VS Code extension to run with a embedded server using process io)
- `org.xtext.example.mydsl` (contains the dsl)
- `org.xtext.example.mydsl.ide` (contains the dsl specific customizations of the Xtext language server)
- `org.xtext.example.mydsl.tests`

## Building in Details

1. Make sure that `java -version` is executable and pointing to a Java 8+ JDK.
2. Type `code`. If the command is not known, open VS Code and select *View / Command Palette*. Enter `code` and select to install `code` on the path.
1. Run `./gradlew startCode` to build the DSL and the VS Code extensions.

### Scenario 1 (embedded server)

1. Install the self-contained extension into VS Code using
    `code --install-extension vscode-extension-self-contained/build/vscode/vscode-extension-self-contained-0.0.1.vsix`
2. Run a second instance of vscode on the demo folder `code demo`

### Scenario 2 (client-only with separate server process)

1. Run `./gradlew run` or launch RunServer from Eclipse.
2. Open `vscode-extension` in VS Code and `F5` to launch new editor (you may need a Debug -> Start Debugging initally).
1. Open folder `demo` in the new editor.


### Build VS Code Extension Package manually (manually Gradle)

```
npm install -g vsce
cd vscode-extension
vsce package
cd ../vscode-extension-self-contained
vsce package
```

### Hints

For Other Xtext/VSCode versions please also check other branches for newer Xtext Versions that also support newer vscode versions
The Theia example is no longer working, you have to either use VScode plugin in Theia (see newer branches) or change to the code to use older theia
Atom language client is dead. We plan to update to a fork. See https://github.com/itemis/xtext-languageserver-example/issues/73
